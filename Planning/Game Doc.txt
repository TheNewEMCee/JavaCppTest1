Step 1:


Create classes for each data type called “CInt” (C++ int), “JString” (Java String), etc. Each class should (at least for C++, I’ll figure out Java later (or not, that’s technically Christine’s job)) have the following:
Private:

private:
   std::string name;
   int lineToReference;
   int value;
   std::ifstream inFile;
   std::ofstream outFile;
public:
   CInt();
   CInt(std::string name, int lineToReference, int value, std::ifstream inFile);
   ~CInt();
   void update();
};
